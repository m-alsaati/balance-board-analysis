# Balance Board Signal Analysis
Accelerometers are sensors that can detect motion in 3D (x, y, and z directions) and have found use in rehabilitation applications involving patient balance and stability.
Balance boards are a tool that incorporates accelerometers and are used in rehabilitation to exercise core and limb muscles to increase their strength, therefore improving the patient’s balance and stability.
In order to present the accelerometer data in a more digestible format, we can compile the x-axis and y-axis data for a patient into a stabilogram. A stabilogram is a graphical representation of the patient’s movement centered around zero. It represents the variation of movement from the accelerometer's rest position and can be used to determine how much sway is exhibited by the patient and how stable their movement is.

### Plots of Cross Correlation of raw data with reference data

Correlation coefficients were also calculated for each dataset to determine how well a subject maintains their balance compared to the reference data, and the closer the coefficients are to a value of 1, the better the subject's perfomance.

### Stabilograms
A stabilogram provides a visual representation of the subjects balance around the reference point, that being the rest position of the accelerometer.
